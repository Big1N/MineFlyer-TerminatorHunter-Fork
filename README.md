# HunterBot Baritone Fork

hey i would like to introduce you to a bot that is disigned to be a hunter in a speed run ect. if you want to improve on him and stuff plese feel free to could really use the help all in all if you want to play him you will need to install a program called node and than you need to edit the space on top of the code any notpad software would do and puit your ip and port there you can also have it logon to your minecraft account to give it the ability to have a skin and join prenium servers. After you do that you will need to enter your cmd or any command prompt and type on the file location "node index.js" and the bot will join your game after that you will need to give him stuff if you want like armor, weapons, blocks and if you wish a shield he can use a shield he will auto equipt the stuff and food if you want him to eat he will eat autimaticly. you have him equipted and ready to go all you have to do now is type in chat "hunt me" and he will begin to persue you and try to kill you if you want him to stop just type "stop" and he will stop. If you want him to follow you to a new location just say "follow me" and he will go to the location you were at without killing you XD. Sound Good right in my opinion hes better than bariton in speed and cauculating pathfinding he doesnt bug out in water like baritone or in other stuff. 

But any good system has its kincks as soon as he kills you he will go back into idle, he only chases the person who says hunt me in chat, he sometimes bugs out on breaking a block where he cant break the block, his parkour skills suck for an unknown reason, he sometimes doesnt attack you with the sword he attacks you with his fist for some strange reason, you cant edit or see his invintory, and he doesnt reconise doors "Yet" im still working on that.

 The reason why i didnt fix these bugs is that i dont know how im only a bigginer on the codeing world and learning how and i dont have any friends or anyone to help me so if anyone whos seeing this and wants to help out with this project than please do so it will mean alot to me.

# Goals I had For Him

a learning agruithum so he can use big brain moves and it works in a certain sense but is buggy at times with it.

I had pleanned on making him a hide and seek mode where he doesnt know where you are and patrols a certain area and when he sees you he will try to kill you and when you get out of his sight for a while he will go back on patrol.

survival mode where he can craft his own tools and armor to try to kill you in speed run mode i was really close on having this come to reality but he breaks and crashes when doing so sadly again im a beginner so idk how to fix that so i reverted him back until further notice

i have planned on giving him an ability to sprint by jumping up and down you know.

Having him be able to swim after you only in 1.13 and above and if he has a boat in his invintory he will place it and come after you across the ocean i also had the ability to jump alot to go fatser under 2 block area but sadly it wasnt sucsesful and crashed alot during the teasting on that feachure so i had to revert him back.

# All in All Hope You Enjoy My Bot And Sorry For The Long ReadMe
